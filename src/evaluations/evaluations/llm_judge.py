# Shared rubric/prompt for answer equivalence evaluation
ANSWER_EQUIVALENCE_RUBRIC = """You are evaluating whether two answers to the same question are semantically equivalent.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Rate as EQUIVALENT if:
✓ Both answers contain the same core factual information
✓ Both directly address the question asked
✓ The key claims and conclusions are consistent
✓ Any additional detail in one answer doesn't contradict the other

Rate as NOT EQUIVALENT if:
✗ Factual contradictions exist between the answers
✗ One answer fails to address the core question
✗ Key information is missing that changes the meaning
✗ The answers lead to different conclusions or implications

GUIDELINES:
- Ignore minor differences in phrasing, style, or formatting
- Focus on semantic meaning rather than exact wording
- Consider both answers correct if they convey the same essential information
- Be tolerant of different levels of detail if the core answer is preserved
- Evaluate based on what a person asking this question would need to know
